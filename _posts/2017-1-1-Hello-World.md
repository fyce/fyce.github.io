title: Hello World!

I finally took the plunge into blogging to:  
- better understand the concepts I'll be writing about i.e. learning by teaching/explanation  
- practice better organization of my thoughts while communicating and sharing ideas with others  

I'll mostly write about programming-related topics, documenting some of my work and other interesting things that grab my attention.
